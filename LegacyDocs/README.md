AudioTalk legacy documentation has moved to a dedicated repository:

- https://github.com/Fountain-Coach/AudioTalk-LegacyDocs

Contents now hosted there include:
- `VISION.md`, `STATUS-AUDIT.md`
- `ScoreKit.txt`
- `ScoreKit_*.pdf`, `AudioTalk_*.pdf`
- Other longâ€‘form narrative PDFs and notes

This monorepo remains minimal and canonical for current engineering:
- `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `spec/openapi.yaml`
